= Assignment
operator: `=`

- Assigns value to a variable, and returns that value

    - Can be chained; RTL associativity
        `var x = y = z = 0;`

// TODO: Cover this after math. operators?
- compound assignment ops: append "=" after the other operator symbols

    - Operators that can have compound assignment:

        - mathematical
        - bitwise
        - string concatenation


- non-numeric values; pitfalls
// TODO: I don't know what I meant here... Type matching? Conversion?
