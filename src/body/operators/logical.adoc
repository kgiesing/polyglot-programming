= Logical Operators
operators: `&&, ||, !`
* In strongly typed languages, result is always Boolean (true/false)
* In loosely typed languages, result is *the value of the final operand*
** Example: JavaScript - setting a default value
        `x = x || 'hello'; // If x is undefined, it will now be "hello"`
        This **will not work** in strongly-typed lang.'s like Java or C++!
* Most often used in flow control statements, such as `if` or `while`

== Short-Circuit Evaluation
the second argument is only evaluated if the first argument is not sufficient for determining the result

* `&&` (AND): the second argument is only evaluated if the first argument is true
* `||` (OR): the second argument is only evaluated if the first argument is false

NOTE: Because the second argument is not even _evaluated,_ any errors it may cause will not be caught.
    This is often intentional.

example:

// Avoid divide-by-zero error
denominator != 0 && numerator / denominator < 0
