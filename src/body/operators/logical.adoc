= Logical Operators
operators: `&&, ||, !`
- In strongly typed languages, result is always Boolean (true/false)
- In loosely typed languages, result is *the value of the final operand*
    - Example: JavaScript - setting a default value
        `x = x || 'hello'; // If x is undefined, it will now be "hello"`
        This **will not work** in strongly-typed lang.'s like Java or C++!
- short-circuiting
