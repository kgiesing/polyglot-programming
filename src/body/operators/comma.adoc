= The Comma Operator
operator: `,`
* evaluates expressions, LTR, returns results of last one, discards the other results
** in strongly-typed languages, all expressions must return the same type

* most common use is declaring/defining multiple variables at once
** [show example]

* not to be confused with comma as separator (e.g. fn. params)
