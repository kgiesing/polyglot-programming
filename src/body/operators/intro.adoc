= Operators
* Tokens that represent operations on values (like math symbols)

== Terminology and concepts
* Arity: # of operands
** unary, binary, or ternary (1, 2, or 3 respectively) - most are binary
* Associativity (RTL vs. LTR)
* Operator precedence
* Operator overloading: same token may represent different operation, depending upon operand types
** A variety of _ad hoc polymorphism_
** in many C-style languages, "+" can mean either numeric addition,
      or string concatenation (but not PHP)
** C++ allows programmers to overload operators; others don't (the
      overloading is part of the language specification)
