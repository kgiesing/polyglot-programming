= Bitwise Operators
operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>` (Java, JavaScript)
* Operate on the bits of binary numbers

* Operands must be "integer" type: `int`, `char`; `number`
** Issue: negative integers - remember 2's compliment!
** Issue, weakly-typed languages: non-integer operands

* May have compound assignment
