= String Operators
- All string operators are _overloaded_ operators

== string concatenation
operators: `+` (most), `.` (PHP)

== compound assignment
operators: `+=` (most), `.=` (PHP)
- can think of it as "append operator"

== equality operators
operators: `==` (all), `===` (JS, PHP)
- strict equality compares _references_ (i.e. whether it's the same object/array)
- non-strict equality compares strings by value
    - only in interpreted languages

== comparison operators
operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- lexicographical comparison: C, C++, JS, PHP
- not allowed: Java, C#
