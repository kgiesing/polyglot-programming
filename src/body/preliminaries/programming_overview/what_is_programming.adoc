= What is programming?

== Computers and Programs
- Computer is a machine that can be instructed to perform operations on data
    - Accepts data as input, process data using instructions, sends processed data to output
- Digital computer: a computer that processes data as _discrete_ values
    - Contrast to analog computer, that processes data as _continuous_ values
    - Electronically, discrete values are represented by voltage threshholds
        - example: 3V - 5V = "on", -3V - -5V = "off"
        - switching in modern computers is done by a _transistor_ (old computers used vaccuum tubes)
    - Numerically, discrete values are represented (by humans) as _binary digits_
        - "off" = 0, "on" = 1

- Program: the set of instructions for a computer
    - Theoretically, may be either analog or digital instructions

- Hardware: the parts of a computer that exist as physical objects
    - Not all computers have hardware
        - Example: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Redstone_computers[Redstone computers]

- Software: a program, or set of programs, distributed separately from the hardware on which it runs
    - Often, people also use it to include things that are part of the distribution but are not programs:
        - Assets such as images, audio, video files
        - Configuration files
        - Instruction manuals
    - The only thing "software" does _not_ include is computer hardware

== Single-purpose vs. general-purpose computers
- Single-purpose: the computer has one program, and can only run that program
    - also called _fixed-program_ computer
    - Examples: calculator, ATM, traffic light control systems
- General-purpose: the computer can take a program as input data
    - also called _stored program_ computer
    - Since a program is data, a general-purpose computer can also give
      back another program as output; important when we talk about compilers
      and interpreters
    - Allows program to be distributed separately from the physical machine
    - Examples: PC's, smart phones

== Programming languages
- A language that is used to create a program for a (general-purpose) computer
    - Not programming languages:
        - _markup_ languages (Markdown, AsciiDoc, HTML)
        - _style sheet_ languages (CSS)
        - _data format_ languages (JSON, CSV)
    - Above is not intended to be derrogatory!

- What a program does
    - represents data and metadata ("nouns" and "adjectives")
    - operates upon that data ("verbs")
    - input and output
      - input data; operate on that data; output (new) data
      - "input" and "output" are abstract concepts
        - UI (keyboard, mouse, (touch)screen); hard disk; DB; tape drive;
          call to Web API; etc.
- Program follows an *algorithm* for its operations
    - sequence of instructions that perform a task
      - Recipe analogy
    - Flow control
      - branching, iteration
      - termination condition(s)

=== Language syntax vs. semantics

Syntax:: determines what constitutes a well-formed string in a specific programming language
    Example: infix - `2 + 3` is syntactically correct; `+ 2 3` is not

Semantics:: deals with the meaning of programming languages; how the syntax is interpreted in an abstract sense
    originates with advanced theories of computation; won't cover that +
    (theories largely due to Robert W. Floyd, 1936 - 2001)

    Static semantics;;
        whether a well-formed string has meaning +
        Example: `2 + '5'` may be syntactically correct, but what is the result?
          .. `'25'` (2 converted to char)
          .. `7` ('5' converted to number)
          .. `55` (2 + ASCII value of '5')
          .. Nothing; `+` requires numbers on both sides, so it's semantically incorrect

    Language semantics;;
        what the meaning of a semantically correct string actually is +
        In above example, language semantics would choose between a, b, and
          c; d cannot be part of language semantics (since it's incorrect)
