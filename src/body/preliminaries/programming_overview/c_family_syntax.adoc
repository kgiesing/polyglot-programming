= C-family programming languages

== Why C-style?
- It's the most widely-used family of syntaxes
- Different semantics for same syntax, so we can discuss semantics separately
- I know it better than anything else...

== What constitutes a "C-family" syntax?
- Statements end with a semicolon
- Statement blocks delimited by curly braces ("Curly-bracket languages"),
  not indentation ("off-side rule")
- Uses infix operator notation (not e.g. Hungarian)
- Extra whitespace is ignored
- Uses C syntax for calling functions

== Which languages?
- C, C++, C=, Java, JavaScript, PHP
- Almost but not quite: Swift, Perl
- Not C-style: BASIC, Lua, Pascal, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Objective-C,
  F=, most functional languages (Scheme, Lisp, Haskell), XSLT
