= Source Code Writing Tools

There are a number of different tools that you can use to write source code.

The source code itself is simply a plain text file (with a different file extension), so you can use any text editor to write it.
However, there are certain tools that will make the process much easier.
I have covered some of the more popular tools below.

NOTE: Source code must be *plain* text, without any formatting or page information.
    This means that word processors (such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs) are ill-suited for writing source code.
    Word processors save their files in a format that cannot be read by either compilers or interpreters.
