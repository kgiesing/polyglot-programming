= Text Editors

== "Vanilla" text editors (usually bundled with OS)
* Notepad (Windows)
* TextEdit (OSX)
* vi/vim (Linux) - can be specialized

== Source code editors
* More features:
** Syntax highlighting
** Automatic indentation
** Code auto-completion
** "Code folding" - ability to show/hide blocks of code at a time
** Extensible, by plugins or scripts
* Popular source code editors
** Notepad++ (Windows; proprietary)
** SublimeText (OSX, started porting to other OS's; proprietary)
** Atom (cross-platform, open source)
** GNU Emacs (Linux, ported to other OS's; open source)
*** Note: Emacs is not a source code editor out of the box, and must
    be customized; but it is highly customizable, and many
    programmers use it for source code
