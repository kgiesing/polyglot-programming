= Version Control Systems

* A directed acyclical graph (DAG) in graph theory

* include image here

== Centralized vs. Distributed

* Centralized: client-server approach
** Single server acts as the *repository* (a.k.a. "repo") of source code
** Each programmer's machine is a client
** Centralized VCS's:
*** CVS
*** Subversion

* Distributed: peer-to-peer approach
** Each programmer's machine holds an entire copy of the repo
** Distributed VCS's:
*** Git
**** GitHub
**** Atlassian Bitbucket
*** Mercurial

== Repos and Local Copies

* repository (aka "repo"): a location where the source code and its complete
    revision history is held

* local copy/working copy: the copy of the code on the user's machine
** "working copy" may also refer to a local copy at a specific time

* pull: to retrieve all revisions from a repo to a local copy

* push: to submit all revisions from a local copy to a repo

* clone vs. check out
** clone: to initially create a local copy of a repo
*** Term is usually used with distributed VCS's like Git; centralized
            VCS's don't copy the revision history (just code)
** check out: to update a local copy

* commit: a set of revisions added to the repo at one time
** Commits are done manually, not when files are changed on disk
** Commits include messages, to explain what changes were made
** For centralized VCS's, commits must be pushed when made; for distributed
        VCS's, commits only affect the local copy of the repo until pushed

== Branching and Merging

* branch: a separate "track" of code; exists separately from other branches,
    so that they can be revised separately, without conflicts
** Example: a "main" branch for software that represents a released version,
        and another branch for working on a specific feature

* merge: to take the code from one branch, and include it into another branch
** Most commonly, you merge a branch into the master branch (but not always)
** merge vs. rebase (Git)
