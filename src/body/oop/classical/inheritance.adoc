= Inheritance

== Superclasses and Subclasses
a.k.a. base classes and derived classes

== Multiple Inheritance
* Only in C++; C#, Java, PHP support only single inheritance

=== Deadly Diamond of Death

== Virtual Methods
* C++: must be explicitly declared using `virtual` keyword
* C#/Java/PHP: methods are always virtual

=== Virtual Methods and Lookup Tables

== Abstract Classes and Methods
abstract method:: virtual method that has no implementation
* called a _pure virtual_ method in C++

abstract class:: class with one or more pure virtual methods
* Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
* Meant to be a base class for derived classes to implement
* Usually a "partial implementation" of some kind of functionality,
    _or_ implements helper methods for derived classes

== Interfaces
interface:: a class with nothing but abstract/pure virtual methods
* Purpose is to define an interface that an object must follow (hence the name)
* In C++, these are simply pure virtual classes
* In C#/Java/PHP, defined using `interface` keyword (rather than `class`)
** Because there is no conflicting implementation, _inheriting multiple interfaces is allowed_
