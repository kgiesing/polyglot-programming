= Flavors of OOP

== Classical OOP
("Classical" refers to the use of classes; not like "classical music")

* most common form: C++, C#, Java; JavaScript simulates it
** ECMAScript 2014 (aka ES6) has "syntactic sugar" that allows JavaScript syntax to mimic classical OOP syntax
* objects are instances of a class (abstract data type)
* objects are instantiated using a class's constructor
* inheritance relationships must be explicitly declared when declaring the class - esp. for explicitly typed languages

== Prototypal OOP
(Note: no relation at all to function prototypes!)

* objects are "cloned" from another object (their prototype)
** "cloning" may not be copying; obj. may contain reference
** once cloned, a specific object may be given its own properties
** prototyping achieves inheritance
* JavaScript is only C-syntax lang. Lua is another; lib support in Perl, Python, R
