= Namespaces
* Grouping of identifiers (names) under one, overarching identifier (name)
* Purpose:
** Reduce naming conflicts (scope)
** Conceptual convenience
** Effecient inclusion - include/require only what is needed
** Information hiding (somewhat)
** File system organization - each is its own file or sub-folder

* What are the difference between namespaces and static classes?
** You can't instantiate them
** In compiled languages, they only define a scope, so the compiler can
    optimize them away (they aren't in bytecode)
