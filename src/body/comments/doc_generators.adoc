= Comments for Automatic Documentation Generators

== how it works
* Documentation generator scans code for comments, outputs human-readable
    documentation: HTML, Linux `man` files, etc.
* Google Closure uses these comments for transpiling

== brands:
* Javadoc
* Doxygen (NOTE: multiple syntaxes - "Javadoc" style is only one of many)
* PHPDoc/phpDocumentor
* JSdoc
** Google Closure compiler

== common tags:
* `@author`: author of code (usually file, could be block)
* `@deprecated`: deprecated code
    "deprecated" = code that is old, and discouraged, but still supported
    (usually for backwards compatibility)
* `@param`: param type/description
* `@return`: return type/description
* `@see`: "see also" link
* `@throws`: if function/method/etc. throws error type
* `@version`: version number
