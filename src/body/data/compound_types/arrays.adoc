= Arrays
- array: numerically-ordered sequence of values
- Terminology
    - element: the data that is stored at one position
    - index: the position number of the element
- indexes:
    - arrays are always zero-indexed
    - index must be integer type (`char`, `byte` or `int`, w/modifiers)
    - index must be positive (negative = runtime error)
- elements:
    - elements are mutable
    - Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous arrays
      - Homogeneous: elements must be of same type
        C, C++
      - Heterogeneous: elements may be of different types
        Java, JavaScript
    - C++: cannot be references - use pointers instead
      (reference types in other lang's behave like ptrs, so they're OK)
- array lengths (sizes):
    - in static (usually compiled) languages, must be explicitly fixed
    - in dynamic (usually interpreted) languages, is not fixed
- Syntax
    - array literals
      - C/C++/C#/Java:
        `int[] arr = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}; // length fixed at 5`
      - JavaScript:
        `var arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];`
      - PHP:
        ```
        $arr = array(5, 4, 3, 2, 1); // All versions
        $arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];      // PHP >= 5.4
        ```
    - accessing elements
      - access array element by its index: square brackets
        `x = arr[1]; // x has value of 4`
        `$x = $arr[1];   // PHP (and Perl)`
      - each element can be assigned a value independently
        `arr[2] = 6;  // arr is now [5, 4, 6, 2, 1]`
        `$arr[2] = 6; // PHP (and Perl)`
- Semantics
    - C/C++:
      - array value is location of base address: `(&arr[0])`
        - "simulated reference" - ptr that doesn't use ptr notation
      - array access uses pointer arithmetic
        `arr[2] == *(arr + 2 * sizeof(arr[0]))`
      - Danger! No bounds checking!
        `arr[100] = 5; // C/C++ will do this w/out error`
        - Especially dangerous for C-string functions
        - May be exploited for buffer overflow attacks
    - C#/Java/JavaScript: arrays are objects
      - Out-of-bounds access/assignment caught & handled
        - JavaScript: access -> 'undefined', assignment -> expands array
        - Others: results in runtime error
      - Arrays have methods/properties - see sect. on objects
    - PHP: arrays are dictionaries (see below)
      ```
      $arr[1];   // 4
      $arr["1"]; // also 4 - string is cast to integer
      ```
