= Arrays
* array: numerically-ordered sequence of values
* Terminology
** element: the data that is stored at one position
** index: the position number of the element
* indexes:
** arrays are always zero-indexed
** index must be integer type (`char`, `byte` or `int`, w/modifiers)
** index must be positive (negative = runtime error)
* elements:
** elements are mutable
** Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous arrays
*** Homogeneous: elements must be of same type
        (C, C++)
*** Heterogeneous: elements may be of different types
        (C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP)
** C++: cannot be references - use pointers instead
      (reference types in other lang's behave like ptrs, so they're OK)
* array lengths (sizes):
** in static (usually compiled) languages, must be explicitly fixed
** in dynamic (usually interpreted) languages, is not fixed
* Syntax
** array literals
*** C/C++/C#/Java:
[source, C]
-----
int[] arr = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}; // length fixed at 5;
-----

*** JavaScript:
[source, javascript]
-----
var arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
-----
*** PHP:
[source,php]
-----
$arr = array(5, 4, 3, 2, 1); // All versions
$arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];      // PHP >= 5.4
-----
** accessing elements
*** access array element by its index: square brackets
[source, C]
-----
x = arr[1]; // x has value of 4
-----
[source, PHP]
-----
$x = $arr[1];
-----
*** each element can be assigned a value independently
[source, C]
-----
arr[2] = 6;  // arr is now [5, 4, 6, 2, 1]
-----
[source, PHP]
-----
$arr[2] = 6; // PHP
-----

* Semantics
** C/C++:
*** array value is location of base address: `(&arr[0])`
**** "simulated reference" - ptr that doesn't use ptr notation
*** array access uses pointer arithmetic
[source, C]
-----
arr[2] == *(arr + 2 * sizeof(arr[0]));
-----
*** Danger! No bounds checking!
[source, C]
-----
arr[100] = 5; // C/C++ will do this w/out error
-----
**** Especially dangerous for C-string functions
**** May be exploited for buffer overflow attacks
** C#/Java/JavaScript: arrays are objects
*** Out-of-bounds access/assignment caught & handled
**** JavaScript: access -> 'undefined', assignment -> expands array
**** Others: results in runtime error
*** Arrays have methods/properties - see sect. on objects
** PHP: arrays are dictionaries (see below)
[source, php]
-----
$arr[1];   // 4
$arr["1"]; // also 4 - string is cast to integer
