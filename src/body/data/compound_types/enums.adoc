= Enums
* enum: "enumerated type"/"enumeration"
* collection of named values, usually immutable
* Rationale: type safety
* Referred to by name - value itself is not important
* Value is considered "numeric" type (can be used in switch, etc.)
* Examples: days of the week, suit in deck of cards
[source, c]
-----
if (day == Days.MONDAY) /* ...etc. */
if (suit == Suits.HEARTS) /* ...etc. */
-----

== Syntax
* Basic definition (C/C++/C#/Java):
[source, c]
-----
enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}; /* Semicolon necessary in C/C++; not Java/C# */
-----
* C/C++: can use `typedef` to avoid typing "enum":
