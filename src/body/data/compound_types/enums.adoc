= Enums
- enum: "enumerated type"/"enumeration"
- collection of named values, usually immutable
- Rationale: type safety
- Referred to by name - value itself is not important
- Value is considered "numeric" type (can be used in switch, etc.)
- Examples: days of the week, suit in deck of cards
    ```
    if (day == Days.MONDAY) ...
    if (suit == Suits.HEARTS) ...
    ```
- Syntax:
    - Basic definition (C/C++/C#/Java):
      ```
      enum Day {
          SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
          THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
      }; // Semicolon necessary in C/C++; not Java/C#
      ```
    - C/C++: can use `typedef` to avoid typing "enum":
