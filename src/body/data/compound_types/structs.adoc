= struct: "structure"

- Used widely in C (and available in C++/C#) - why talk about it?
    - Classes have their origins in structs (C -> C++ -> Java -> C#)
    - You should know about them anyway
- Named collection of variables, of any type
    - Similar to associative array, but "keys" are variable identifiers
    - a struct's variables are called members or fields
- Member access operator: "dot operator"
- structs are value types! All fields copied on assignment
- Pointers to structs:
    - Unwieldy syntax: `*(point).x`
    - "Arrow operator:" another member access operator, specifically for ptrs
      `point->x`
      - PHP uses this operator to access properties of objects; more later
- Syntax:
    - creating struct: (Remember semicolon!)
      ```c
      struct Point {
          int x;
          int y;
      } a, b, c; // Declares variables of "struct Point" type - optional
      ```
    - using struct:
      `struct Point min = {1, 1}; // Declaration and initialization`
- Using typedef with structs:
    ```
    typedef struct {
        int x;
        int y;
    } Point; // Point is type identifier, not variable declaration!
    ```
    - Why?
      `Point min = {1, 1}; // No "struct" keyword`
- Using forward declarations
    - when you need struct to contain pointer to its own type:
      ```
      typedef struct {
          Node* next;  // Won't compile! "Node" isn't yet declared
      } Node;
      // Solution:
      typedef struct N {
          N* next;     // "N" declared - will compile
      } Node;
      ```
