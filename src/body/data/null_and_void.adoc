== Null and void
- "null" is reference type; signifies that nothing is referenced
    - Evaluates to false in Boolean expression
    - C/C++: `NULL` is macro (`#define`) for integer 0 - not type safe!
    - C++11: `nullptr`
    - C#/Java/JavaScript: `null` keyword
    - JavaScript: `undefined` keyword
        - represents and undefined variable or object property

- uninitialized variables
    - C/C++: garbage (whatever was previously in memory)
    - C#/Java: reference types are null, primitive types are "zero"
    - JavaScript: `undefined`
      - var's must be explicitly assigned the value null

- void:
    - explicitly typed lang's: return type of fn that doesn't return value
    - C: `void*`
        - pointer with no explicit type ("raw" pointer)
        - Uses:
            - returned from memory allocation functions (`malloc`, `calloc`)
            - may be used in compound types
        - must be cast to actual type when dereferenced:
            `char* str = (char*) malloc(LENGTH * sizeof(char));`

- others
    - JavaScript: `NaN`
        - unequal to anything else, including `NaN`
    - PHP: `NAN`
        - because it's a non-zero floating-point number, coerced to `TRUE`
