= Boolean Types

NOTE: The name "Boolean" comes from George Boole (1815 â€“ 1864), the English logician and mathematician.
    Among other things, he was the founder of Boolean algebra, which is widely used in digital electronics, logic, and set theory.
    A full explanation of Boolean algebra is outside the scope of this book, but it is definitely required learning for any serious programmer.
    (It's also one of the easier branches of mathematics to learn, so fret not.)

A _Boolean_ is a piece of data that can be represented as two values: _true_ and _false._
As in spoken English, these values are mutually exclusive; a value that is true cannot also be false, and vice versa.

Boolean values can be used represent anything with two distinct values or states.
For example, they can represent whether a light switch is on or off, or whether a button on an HTML page is shown or hidden.

Boolean values are most commonly used in flow control statements.
These statements execute different blocks of code, depending upon whether a value is true or false.
Flow control statements will be covered in a later section in this book.

Boolean values have a strong correlation to binary digits.
In Boolean algebra, true is represented as `1`, and false is represented as `0`.

Because of this correlation, you may think (as I once did) that a Boolean data type is represented as a single bit in memory.
However, you would be wrong.
This is mainly due to the arcitecture of computer processors.
Processors simply cannot use values smaller than their register size.

== "Booleans" in C

Because Boolean values are so important and widely used, you would think that C would support them from its earliest days.
Surprisingly, you would be wrong.
(Essentially, Dennis Ritchie did not consider type safety to be as important as it turned out to be.
    footnote:["Other issues, particularly type safety and interface checking, did not seem as important then as they became later."
    - http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/docs/chistory.html[The Development of the C Language]])

Instead, many C programmers used the `int` type to represent Boolean values.
This convention was generally followed:

* The `int` value `0` represented Boolean false.
* The `int` value `1` represented Boolean true.

However, this was merely a convention, and not any kind of official standard.
For example, to save memory, a programmer might use a `char` type instead of an `int`.
And there was no particular reason to use `1`, since in the C language, _any_ non-zero value evaluates to `true` when converted to a Boolean type.
(I will have much more to say about Boolean conversion in the section covering logical operators.)

To standardize C's treatment of Booleans, the C99 standard created a library to define Boolean types.
This became part of the C Standard Library, and is shipped with any compiler that supports C99 or later.
To use it, you must include the `<stdbool.h>` header file.

That library explicitly defines `true` as the integer value `1`, and `false` as the integer value `0`.
So, you could also use `1` and `0` rather than `true` or `false`.
But I would not recommend this, for two reasons:

1. It makes your code less clear; using a Boolean type reveals your intent.
2. If the standard changes in the future, for whatever reason, then your code will break.

Here is an example:
[source,c]
-----
#include <stdbool.h>

bool isWednesday = true;
bool isThursday = false;
-----

If you absolutely can not use the C99 library, then I suggest you use the relevant `int` values:
[source,c]
-----
int isWednesday = 1;
int isThursday = 0;
-----
This will, at least, make it _likely_ to be compatible with other C libraries or programs.

== Booleans in C++, Java, and C#

By the time C++, Java, and C# were invented, the problems with C's handling of Booleans was widely recognized.
So, fortunately, all these languages support a native Boolean type.
The Boolean type and literals are all keywords in these languages,
and no special library or header file is required to work with them.

All of these languages use the same literals for Boolean types:
* `true` represents Boolean true.
* `false` represents Boolean false.

However, the languages have _slightly_ different ways to declare a Boolean type:
* C++ and C# use the `bool` keyword.
* Java uses the `boolean` keyword.

Here is an example in C++ or C#:
[source,{cpp}]
-----
bool isWednesday = true;
bool isThursday = false;
-----

Java is nearly identical:
[source,java]
-----
boolean isWednesday = true;
boolean isThursday = false;
-----

== Booleans in JavaScript and PHP

In JavaScript and PHP, variables and constants do not have an explicit type.
For this reason, they do not have a type named `bool` or `boolean`.

However, both languages have _literals_ that represent Boolean true or false.
Each language has a slightly different literal syntax:

* In JavaScript, Boolean values are represented as either `true` or `false`.
    These literals are case-sensitive.
* In PHP, Boolean values are represented as either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
    These literals are _not_ case-sensitive.
    So, `TRUE` can also be written `True`, `true`, or even `tRuE` if you really want to.

Both of these languages have (somewhat confusing) rules for evaluating variables as Boolean values.
These rules will becovered in the section about logical operators.
