= Arithmetic  Types

== Explicitly-Typed Languages
C, C++, Java, C#

=== Integer Types

* `int`
* literals:
** decimal: `18`
** hex: `0x12`
** octal: `022` - note leading zero (don't include in decimals)
** binary: `0b10010`

==== Signed and Unsigned Type Modifiers


* `signed`
* `unsigned`
* literals:
** unsigned: `2u` or `2U`
* Java has only signed types

==== Long and Short Type Modifiers

* `short`
* `long`
* `long long`
* literals

=== Floating-Point Types

* `float`
* `double`
* `long double`
* literals:
** float: `0.2f` or `0.2F`
** double: `0.2`
** long double: `0.2l` or `0.2L` - use the latter so `l` isn't confused with `1`

== Implicitly-Typed Languages

=== JavaScript

* Number type: 64-bit floating-point; no integer or unsigned data types
* `NaN`: "Not a Number" - result when attempting to do a mathematical operation on non-numeric data
* `Infinity` and `-Infinity`: result when dividing by `0` or `-0` (respectively)

=== PHP

* integers
** always unsigned
** size is platform-dependent (usually 32-bit)
** overflow results in conversion to a floating-point number

* floating-point
** size is platform-dependent (usually 64-bit)
** Warning: internally represented as binary, so e.g. 0.3 will not be exact.
