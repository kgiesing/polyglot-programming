= Explicitly-Typed Languages
C, C++, Java, C#

== Integer Types

* `int`
* literals:
** decimal: `18`
** hex: `0x12`
** octal: `022` - note leading zero (don't include in decimals)
** binary: `0b10010`

== Floating-Point Types

* `float`
* `double`
* literals:
** float: `0.2f` or `0.2F`
** double: `0.2`
** long double: `0.2l` or `0.2L` - use the latter so `l` isn't confused with `1`

== Type Modifiers

=== Signed and Unsigned

* `signed`
* `unsigned`
* literals:
** unsigned: `2u` or `2U`
* Java has only signed types

=== Long and Short

* `short`
* `long`
* `long long`
* literals
