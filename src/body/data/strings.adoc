= Strings of Characters

== lang. semantics
* C/C++: null-terminated array of char elements ("C-string")
* others (managed): immutable object
** can still access as array, but can't assign to it
** JavaScript, PHP: string LITERALS are also objects
      `"Hello, world"[5]; // Comma`
*** Also: Python, Ruby

== Syntax
* Double quotes: all interpret as multi-char string
* single quotes:
** C/C++/C#/Java: must be single char or escape sequence
** PHP: single-quotes do not interpret escape sequences
** JavaScript: no difference (convention is single quotes)

== Character Encodings
* ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange
** Used by C, C++ `char` types
** Uses 1 byte of storage; usually considered unsigned, i.e. 0-255, but this is compiler-dependent;
    values 0-127 are standardized
** *Not* good for representing non-English characters!

// TODO Put this in an appendix or supplimentary chapter?
* UTF: Unicode Transformation Format
** UTF-16: 2 or 4 bytes; 2 bytes for BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane)
*** UCS-2 (Universal Character Set): Earlier encoding; similar to UTF-16
** UTF-8: 1-4 bytes; used to exchange strings in a variety of situations, but especially on the Web

* By language
** C, C++: `char` is ASCII; `wchar_t` is 16-bit "wide character" (encoding is otherwise not specified)
** Java, C#: `char` is 16-bit Unicode (UTF-16 BMP) - U+0000 to U+FFFF
** Javascript: no `char` type; strings are either UTF-16 or UCS-2
    see: https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding
** PHP: no `char` type; string encoding matches encoding of PHP source file
    see: http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.details

== Escape sequences
* Often used to represent control characters
* Table:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C#Table_of_escape_sequences

== String Concatenation
* Most languages: overloaded addition operator, `+`
* PHP: period or "dot" operator, `.`
* Concatenation rules
** Easy string conversion: `s + ''`

== String formatting
* `printf` format:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#Format_placeholder_specification

* String interpolation: variables/expressions in string literals

** PHP: `"` instead of `'`
*** Only works with vars, not expressions

** JavaScript ES6: ``${expression}``

** C#:
*** before 6.0: `String.format("{0}", <expression>)`
*** after 6.0: `$"{<expression>}"`

== String interning
Java, C#, PHP >= 5.4 (Zend implementation), some JS interpreters (V8)

** string literals of the same value are stored (globally) as the same data
** global storage of string literals is called _string pool_
** happens at parse time
