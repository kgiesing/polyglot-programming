= STRINGS
== lang. semantics
* C/C++: null-terminated array of char elements ("C-string")
* others (managed): immutable object
** can still access as array, but can't assign to it
** JavaScript, PHP: string LITERALS are also objects
      `"Hello, world"[5]; // Comma`
*** Also: Python, Ruby

== Syntax
* Double quotes: all interpret as multi-char string
* single quotes:
** C/C++/C#/Java: must be single char or escape sequence
** PHP: single-quotes do not interpret escape sequences
** JavaScript: no difference (convention is single quotes)

== Escape sequences
* Often used to represent control characters
* Table:

== String formatting
* `printf` format:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#Format_placeholder_specification

* String interpolation: variables/expressions in string literals

** PHP: `"` instead of `'`
*** Only works with vars, not expressions

** JavaScript ES6: ``${expression}``

** C#:
*** before 6.0: `String.format("{0}", <expression>)`
*** after 6.0: `$"{<expression>}"`
