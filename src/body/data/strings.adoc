= STRINGS
- lang. semantics
  - C/C++: null-terminated array of char elements ("C-string")
  - others (managed): immutable object
    - can still access as array, but can't assign to it
    - JavaScript, PHP: string LITERALS are also objects
      `"Hello, world"[5]; // Comma`
      - Also: Python, Ruby
- Syntax
  - Double quotes: all interpret as multi-char string
  - single quotes:
    - C/C++/C#/Java: must be single char or escape sequence
    - PHP: single-quotes do not interpret escape sequences
    - JavaScript: no difference (convention is single quotes)
- Escape sequences
  - Often used to represent control characters
