= Named Data

== Explicit vs. Implicit Typing
// TODO: Moar research!
* explicit typing (aka manifest typing)
** representation of data must specify a data type
** usually, static typed: types determined at compile time (when parsed)
        commonly used in compiled languages
** usually, strongly typed: variables may only represent data that matches its
        explicit type
** Languages: C, C++, Java, C#

* implicit typing (aka latent typing)
** representation of data does not have a type
*** data itself, however, always has a type
** usually, dynamically typed: types determined at runtime
*** commonly used in interpreted languages
** usually, weakly typed: variables may represent any type of data
** Languages: JavaScript, PHP

== Variables
* variables: named, mutable lvalues
** similar to variables in mathematics:
        `y = 2x + 5` (here, `x` and `y` are variables)

* identifier: variable's name

* value: data that variable represents
** variable identifier is lvalue; data it stores is rvalue
** when var used as rvalue, the data it represents is used

* sigil: special character to signify that a string of char's is a variable
** PHP: `$`
** comes from Perl: `$`, `#` (hash), `%` (array)

== Constants
* constants: named, immutable lvalues
* signify a constant using a type qualifier
** `const`: C99, C++, C#, PHP > 5.3.0
        - JavaScript ES6 added `const` qualifier
** `final`: Java
** C (before C99) used `#define` preprocessor directive

== Static Data
* only one copy of data exists in memory; kept with global variables in
    compiled lang's
* however, still follows scope rules
* `static` keyword: C, C++, Java

== naming identifiers
* applies not only to vars, but fn's/methods
* general rules:
1. only upper/lower letters, numbers, underscore
** no whitespace (space, tab, return, etc.)
** no operator tokens (+, -, =, ., etc)
** identifiers are case sensitive (car is not Car)
2. cannot start with number
3. cannot be reserved word
** Exception: modern JavaScript allows *object property names*
        to be reserved words, e.g. `dog.catch()`
* Language-specific rules:
** JavaScript: in addition to #1, can use most Unicode chars (but, don't)
      - Many JS lib's use `$` as fn. name (JQuery, etc.)
** PHP: start with `$` sigil
* conventions:
** const: all upper-case, with underscores separating words
** variable names:
*** *usually* start with lower-case letter
**** Exception: user-defined types - class names, interfaces (Java),
            constructor functions (JavaScript) - more on these later
**** Microsoft often starts method names with upper case
*** start with underscore only for "library" or "private" identifiers
**** symbolizes that client code shouldn't use it
*** representing two or more words:
**** procedural: underscore - `two_words`
**** OOP: camel case - `twoWords`
* guidelines:
** names should be semantic - describe what the variable (&etc.) represents
** names should be as short as practical
** borrow names from math when applicable
      `i`, `j`, `k`: iteration, position (from sigma notation, linear algebra, etc.)
      `x`, `y`, `z`: numbers (from algebra, calculus, etc.)
** follow conventions from language's libraries
** all of these rules can be overridden by teachers, employers, teams, etc.

== declaration, initialization, and assignment
* declaration: identifier (& type) of variable is introduced
** not all languages require declaration (PHP doesn't)
** explicitly typed: preceded by type name
** implicitly typed: preceded by "var" keyword (or similar)
* initialization: variable is given initial value
** Often, but not always, done
* assignment: variable is given value (initial or not)
* Both initialization and assignment use the assignment operator: =
** Don't confuse this with testing for equality! Rookie mistake.
* Language support
** Default values (declared but uninitialized)
*** C/C++: garbage - whatever value was previously at memory location
*** C#, Java: zero (numeric primitive), `false` (Boolean), or `null` (reference)
*** JavaScript: `undefined`
** C++: init and assign are separate operations
** PHP does not have separate declaration; declared when initialized

== Syntax
* declare variable `x` (as an integer) without initialization
** C/C++/Java:
      `int x;`
** JavaScript:
      `var x; // ES5 and below`
      `let x; // ES6`
* declare variable `x` (as an integer), initialize to 5
** C/C++/Java:
      `int x = 5;`
** JavaScript:
      `var x = 5; // ES5 and below`
      `let x = 5; // ES6`
** PHP:
      `$x = 5;`
* assign 7 to that variable
** C/C++/Java/JavaScript:
      `x = 7;`
** PHP:
      `$x = 7;`

== Scope
* The _scope_ of an identifier is the part of the program where that identifier is valid
** A valid identifier is said to be _visible_
** Two identifiers will clash if they have the same name, and are in the same namespace
** If an identifier is visible throught the entire program, it is in the _global scope_
** In C-syntax languages, a variable's scope depends upon where it is _declared_
*** Technical term for this is _lexical scope_
*** There is also _dynamic scope,_ but it is not used in any languages covered in this book

=== Namespaces
A _namespace_ is an explicit declaration of a scope in the source code

* Not all languages have explicitly declared scope
** C++, C#, and PHP (>5.3.0) use namespaces
** Java uses packages
** JavaScript uses modules (which are different for Node.js and ES6)
* Most libraries declare their own scope
** The C++ standard libraries use the `std` namespace
** The C# standard libraries use the `System` namespace
** Java uses various different packages
