= TYPE SYSTEMS
- A type is metadata
  - Data is simply bits in memory; type specifies how bits are interpreted
  - Type supplies meaning to the data
- Apply to anything that represents data
  - variables
  - function/method parameters
  - function/method return values
== mutable vs. immutable types
- Mutable: value can be changed after initialization (read/write)
- Immutable: value cannot be changed after initialization (read-only)
    - Operations on the value create a new value if possible; fail if not
    - Many languages have modifiers that specify immutability; see section
      on constants & variables
== value types and reference types
- Value types: represent the data itself
    - often represent scalar data (numbers, single letters, true/false)
- Reference types: represent the data's location in memory
    - often represent a compound data type (array, hash, object)
    - some languages (Python, Ruby) consider all types to be reference types;
      but all C-style languages use value types
== lvalues and rvalues (from C++ terminology)
- lvalue: anything that is capable of having data assigned to it
    ("location value" or "left-hand-side value")
    - usually a variable
- rvalue: anything that is not an lvalue (hence immutable)
    - literals
    - temporary results of expressions, e.g. `2 + 5`
== type manipulation: casting and coercion
- treat values of one type as if it were another
- may be applied to anything with a type - variable, result of expression,
    return value of function, etc.
