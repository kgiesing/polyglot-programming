= Type Systems

Whenever you represent any kind of data in a computer, that data has a _type._
The data type acts like "metadata" - data about the data.

Remember, at the machine level, data is represented as bits in memory.
The data type specifies how this binary data is to be interpreted;
for example, whether to treat it as a letter or as a number.
In this sense, the type supplies _meaning_ to the data.

A language's type system applies to anything in a programming language that is capable of representing data.
This includes:

* Literal representations of data in the code
* Named variables and constants
* The operands and results of operators
* The parameters and return values of functions or methods

We will go into detail about each of those in later sections.

But before we do, we should introduce some concepts that apply to all type systems.
These concepts will help us talk about the similarities and differences between programming languages.

== Literals

A _literal_ is a direct representation of data in the code itself.

An example of a literal is the number five.
To represent the number five in code, you can simply type the character `5`.

Another example of a literal is a character literal, like the letter "C".
To represent this letter in code, you put the character in single-quotes: `'C'`.

This assumes that the language actually supports single characters as a separate type,
as opposed to one type representing _strings_ of characters.
String literals are usually represented by double-quotes: `"Hello, world!"`.

As you can tell even from this brief overview, different languages have different rules for literals,
depending upon which types they support.
We will go over the different ways of representing literals when we cover the specific data type.

== Mutable vs. immutable data

In general, everything that has a type can be considered either mutable or immutable.

If it is _mutable,_ it can be changed after it has been initialized.
You can provide an initial value, then change that value later.

If it is _immutable,_ it cannot be changed after it has been initialized.
Once an initial value has been provided, it must remain at that initial value.
Anything other than a read operation on that data will either produce entirely new data,
or fail with an error, as appropriate.

Different languages have different mutability rules.
Some allow things to be declared explicitly immutable, and some don't.
We will cover this in the section about named data (covering variables and constants).

== Value types and reference types

If something such as a variable directly represents the data in memory, it is a _value type._
Value types are often simple or scalar types: numbers, single letters, or true/false values.

On the other hand, something such as a variable can also be a _reference type._
If it is a reference type, it does not directly represent the data.
Instead, its value is a reference to the memory location of some piece of data.
Reference types often represent some kind of compound data type, such as an object or array.

Some programming languages (such as Python or Ruby) consider all types to be reference types.
But this is not the case with any C-syntax languages.
All the languages covered in this book use both value and reference types.

== Lvalues and rvalues

These terms come from the C++ literature, but they are useful when discussing other languages as well.

An _lvalue_ is anything that is capable of having data assigned to it.
This means an lvalue is mutable.
Things that can be lvalues include variables, and the parameters of functions or methods.

Depending upon who you ask, the term stands for either "location value" or "left-hand-side value."
The first term comes from the fact that an lvalue has a persistent location in memory.
The latter term comes from the fact that that an lvalue can be on the left-hand side of an assignment operator.
Given the behavior of the assignment operator, this really amounts to the same thing.
(The assignment operator is covered later.)

On the other hand, an _rvalue_ is anything that is not an lvalue.
It may have a location in memory, but this location is temporary or read-only.
As you could probably guess, an rvalue is immutable.

An example of an rvalue is the temporary result of an operation, such as `x + 5`.
Another example of an rvalue is a literal representation of data in code, such as `6`.
In neither case could you change those values to, say, `8`.

== Type conversion

All C-syntax languages have the ability to treat data of one type as if it were another.
This conversion can be either explicit or implicit.

With _explicit_ type conversion, the programmer includes the type manipulation command in the text of the code.
Explicit type manipulation is usually called _type casting._
While this is straightforward, it is also very cumbersome, and can be counter-intuitive for certain operations.

With _implicit_ type conversion, the language itself will convert one type of data into another in certain situations.
This is done "behind the scenes," without the programmer explicitly putting the conversion command into the code.
Implicit type conversion is usually called _coercion._
However, other terms are used, such as _type juggling_ (used in the PHP manual).
Some programmers use the term _implicit casting,_
but I will try to avoid this, and reserve the term "casting" for explicit type conversion.

Why would any programming language perform implicit type conversion?
Ultimately, it makes the language easier to use.

Consider, for example, the code `2.5 + 3`.
This seems like a perfectly sensible thing to type, and you would expect the result to be `5.5`.
But now consider that many C-syntax languages treat integers and floating-point numbers as different types.
Without type conversion, this code would throw an error in those languages.
So, instead, those languages convert the integer `2` to a floating-point number, without the programmer having to ask.

Each language has slightly different type conversion rules for equivalent data types,
and each language has different rules for their supported data types.
For this reason, the actual type conversion rules will be given on a case-by-case basis when we cover the different data types.
On the other hand, since programming languages are created for humans,
most of the rules make sense once you think about them.
_(Most_ of them.)
