= Computer hardware

== Components
- motherboard, SoC ("system on chip")

=== CPU
- ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit (aka Execution Unit, Processing Unit)
    - performs all computations
    - integer and floating-point computations are usually separate parts
          of the ALU (or, perhapes, separate ALU's)
    - Modern processors have many ALU's, called "cores"

- Control Unit: handles control flow

- Registers: one word of memory in ALU, used to hold transitory data needed for computation
    - Processor-specific; different architectures have different approaches
    - General-purpose registers: can hold any value (data or address),
          meaning determined by program (not CPU)
    - Special-purpose registers: data has special meaning to CPU
        - instruction pointer/program counter: address of next instruction
            to perform
        - stack pointer: address of the start of stack memory (see below)
        - others: segment (memory), control, program status, interrupt
            - highly architecture-dependent
            - not handled by programmers (outside of ASM)

- cache memory: small amount of memory stored directly on processor
    - used to hold instructions or data that are commonly used, so they won't have to be repeatedly copied from RAM
    - organized by levels: L1, L2, (sometimes) L3
        - lower number mean less memory, but faster

=== RAM (random-access memory): volatile (erased after powered off)
- when most CS people say "memory," they really mean "RAM";
        most programmers won't have to worry about other kinds

=== I/O (Input/Output): keyboard, mouse, GPU, USB, network card, etc.
- Including hard drives, CD/DVD/Blu-Ray, memory cards, and other varieties of persistent storage

=== Clock generator
- synchronizes the system
- square wave; at each edge, a new cycle of operations is performed

=== Bus: handles data transfer between components

== Representation of program
- "program" is simply a set of electronic signals in memory
      - Often thought of as sequence of 1's and 0's - but this is an abstraction!
        Really, it's +5V (high, "1") or 0V (low, "0"), +/-
- Machine instruction set: set of commands that a processor can run;
      pre-defined by CPU manufacturer
      (commands: "instruction codes" or "processor instructions")
        - very simple: math operations, compare, jump, move to/from reg.
- Machine code: a binary representation of machine instructions
