= Process memory

== static memory
- essentially a copy of the executable file
- usually, fills up lower part of memory; never grows/shrinks (hence the name)
- shared among threads (not copied on thread creation)
- parts ("segments"):
    - code (.text): executable instructions - read-only (OS enforced?)
    - read-only (.rodata): constants (e.g. PI) - read-only (duh)
    - initialized (non-null) data (.data): global var's
    - uninitialized data (.bss): global var's

== stack memory
- automatically created/destroyed with fn call/return (fn's later)
- usually, starts at end of allocated memory, "grows downwards"
- easy to manage; only need to increase/decrease stack pointer
- NOT shared among threads

== heap memory (aka free store)
- creation/destruction is not automatic
- POSIX: starts just past static memory, "grows upwards"
    - Windows is more complicated; there can be multiple heaps

- harder to manage
- shared among threads
