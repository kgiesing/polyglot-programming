Binary number systems, and their relevance to computer hardware and software

== Binary numbers
For a more in-depth discussion, see the Appendix on Binary Mathematics.

=== Numbers in different bases
- terminology
    - digit: unique symbol used to represent a numeric value
    - base: number of unique digits in a positional numeral system (incl. zero)
        - also called radix

- decimal: base 10
    - number system we're familiar with
    - digits: `0` - `9`

- binary: base 2
    - number system used to represent computer state
    - digits: `0` and `1`

- others (see below)
    - hexadecimal: base 16
    - octal: base 8

=== Calculating a numeric value
Calculating each digit:
asciimath:[d * b^i], where:
- _b_ is the base
- _i_ is the position of the digit, *zero-indexed and starting from the right*
- _d_ is the numeric value of the digit

Example: value of `2` in decimal number `6521044`
- _b_ is 10 (because decimal)
- _i_ is 4 (from the right, counting from zero)
- _d_ is 2

value: asciimath:[2 xx 10^4 = 20000]

Example: value of middle `1` in binary number `01001001`
- _b_ is 2 (because binary)
- _i_ is 3 (from the right, counting from zero)
- _d_ is 1

value: asciimath:[1 xx 2^3 = 8]

Calculating total number is summing the value of the digits:
asciimath:[sum_(i=0)^n(d x b^i)]

Example: binary number `1001`

value: asciimath:[(1 xx 2^0) + (0 xx 2^1) + (0 xx 2^2) + (1 xx 2^3) = 9]

== Binary and computers
- bit: Binary digIT

- byte: 8 bits, e.g. `01101101`
    - range: asciimath:[2^8], or 256 values (incl. 0)
    - smallest addressable unit of memory
    - historically, bytes could have other numbers of bits, but now it's standardized

- word: number of bits that can be stored a machine register
    - 32 bit (4 byte): older x86 processors, ARM (mobile)
        - range: asciimath:[2^32], or 4,294,967,296 values (incl. 0)
    - 64 bit (8 byte): new x86 processors (often called x64)
        - range: asciimath:[2^64], or asciimath:[1.8446744 xx 10^19] values (incl. 0)

=== Representing Negative Numbers
- signed vs. unsigned

- a negative number must allocate one bit as the _sign bit_
    - usually, "leftmost" bit
    - usually, `0` = positive and `1` = negative

- signed integers have a lower positive bound
    - No matter what, 8 bits can only represent 256 values
    - unsigned: 0 - 255
    - signed: -127 - 127

- whither negative zero?

=== Representing Floating Point Numbers
- remember, rational numbers are any number that can be expressed as a fraction
- any rational number can be represented as a _floating point_ number;
    binary systems use floating point






== Other Number Systems
Programmers commonly use number systems other than binary and decimal.
These number systems have bases that are multiples of two.
Because of this, they have a convenient relationship to binary numbers.

=== Hexadecimal
- usually shortened to "hex"
- base 16
- digits: `0`-`9` plus `A`-`F` (case unimportant; I'll use upper-case)
- because asciimath:[16 = 2^4], one hex digit = 4 bits, and two hex digits = 1 byte;
    makes it very useful to represent byte values

==== Converting binary to hex
1. Group binary numbers into 4-digit sections: `1011 0100 1001`
    - add leading 0's to leftmost section if necessary
2. Convert each section into one hex digit
    - One option: convert to base 10, then base 10 to base 16 digit
    - Another option: convert directly to base 16 digit - not difficult to memorize

=== Octal
- less common that hex, but still used enough to discuss
- base 8
- digits: `0`-`7`
- because asciimath:[8 = 2^3], one hex digit = 3 bits

==== Converting binary to octal
1. Group binary numbers into 3-digit secions: `101 101 001 001`
    - add leading 0's to leftmost section if necessary
2. Convert each section into one hex digit
    - Since hex digits are a subset of decimals,
        converting each section to decimal will also convert it to hex
