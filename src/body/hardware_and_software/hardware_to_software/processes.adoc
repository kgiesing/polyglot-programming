== Processes, threads, and the OS
== OS: hardware I/O, executing programs, memory, security
* Types questions the OS must answer:
      - Which program responds to UI's (mouse/keyboard/screen touch)?
      - If more than 1 prog, which one should be running on the CPU?
      - When should memory be reclaimed/paged (swapped to disk)?
      - Can this user/program write to this file?
* GUI technically not part of OS, but most OS's come with one

== process: instance of a running program
* "program" does not mean "launched by user, with UI" - process can create ("spawn") other processes; so does OS
* each process has its own allocated memory
* most OS's are multi-process (even iOS devices)

== thread: a "lightweight" process
* same code as parent, but independent execution
* shares parts of memory with parent process (see next section)
* "Thread safe:" operations in one thread don't interfere with operations in another thread (or parent process)
** One thread operates on shared data in memory.
        Does it change that data in another thread?
        If yes, the operation is not thread-safe;
        if not, it's thread-safe
