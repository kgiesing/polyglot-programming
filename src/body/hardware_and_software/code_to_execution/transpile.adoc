= Source-to-source compilation (aka transpiling)
* Takes one higher-level language, compiles it to another higher-level
    language (or even the same language)

== Compile source to same language:
* create backwards-compatible source code
** example: ES6 to JS for older browsers

* source code minimization

== Compile source to different language:
* compile to JavaScript for Web deployment:
    Google Dart, Google Closure compiler, CoffeeScript, TypeScript

* compile Web applications to native application code for mobile devices:
    React Native
