= Virtual Machine Compilation

- Code is compiled to VM-specific bytecode (not native machine code)

- VM takes its own bytecode, translates to native machine code while running
    - VM bytecode instructions very close to native machine instructions
    - Often done at runtime; "Just-In-Time" (JIT)
    - Blocks of machine code can be cached (improves performance)

- Memory is managed; unused objects are destroyed
    - garbage collection (GC): destroying objects that are not referenced
    - usually, GC is done by a "mark-and-sweep" algorithm
    - takes time, and predicting when it happens often difficult/impossible

- Advantages and disadvantages
    - compiled adv.: compile-time validation, bin. file dist.
    - interpreted adv.: cross-platform, managed environment
    - disadvantages: still needs compilation stage (no on-the-fly execution),
      slower(?) than native-machine compilation, overhead from VM & GC

- Note that these VM's are not hypervisors (like VMWare or VirtualBox)

- Languages: Java (JVM), C# (CLR, Mono)
