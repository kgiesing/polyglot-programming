= Virtual Machine Compilation

* Code is compiled to VM-specific bytecode (not native machine code)

* Note that these VM's are not hypervisors (like VMWare or VirtualBox)

* VM takes its own bytecode, translates to native machine code while running
** VM bytecode instructions very close to native machine instructions
** Often done at runtime; "Just-In-Time" (JIT)
** Blocks of machine code can be cached (improves performance)

* Memory is managed; unused objects are destroyed
** garbage collection (GC): destroying objects that are not referenced
** usually, GC is done by a "mark-and-sweep" algorithm
** takes time, and predicting when it happens often difficult/impossible

* Advantages and disadvantages
** compiled adv.: compile-time validation, bin. file dist.
** interpreted adv.: cross-platform, managed environment
** disadvantages: still needs compilation stage (no on-the-fly execution),
      slower(?) than native-machine compilation, overhead from VM & GC

== Common VM's
* JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
** Created by Sun (now Oracle)
** Java; also Closure, Groovy, Scala, implementations of Python, Ruby

* CLR (Common Language Runtime)
** VM component of Microsoft .NET
** C#; also VB.NET, implementations of Python, Scheme, Lisp
** PHP compilation with Phalanger

* Mono
** FOSS implementation of CLR and .NET from Xamarin (now under MS)
** Any languages that compile to CLR can use Mono (but usually modifications are required)

* ART (Android Runtime)
** Java VM used by Android OS
** Replaced Dalvik as of Android 5.0
