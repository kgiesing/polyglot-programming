= Compilation
- Source code is translated into executable machine code
    - AST from parser is "walked" to generate machine code
    - Machine code is determined by compilation target (e.g. computer architecture)

- Linking
    - Not all of the program needs to be compiled at once (e.g. one file is compiled)
    - When executable is created, different compiled sources are linked
    - Re-compilation can be avoided if code hasn't changed

- Advantages and disadvantages
    - Advantages: compile-time code validation, faster, distribute binary file
    - Disadvantages: executable is specific to architecture/OS

- Many vendors; compete for speed, architecture optimization, etc.

- Languages: C, C++

== Common compilers
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
    - FOSS compiler suite
    - C, C++; Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go
    - https://gcc.gnu.org/[GCC website]

- LLVM and Clang
    - FOSS compiler and VM
    - originally "low level virtual machine," but that acronym is now obsolete
    - Clang is the front-end that compiles the source to LLVM bytecode;
        designed to replace the GCC
    - C, C++; Objective-C (arguably most common)
    - http://llvm.org/[LLVM website]
