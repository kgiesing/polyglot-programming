= Compilation
- Source code is translated into executable machine code
    - AST from parser is "walked" to generate machine code
    - Machine code is determined by compilation target (e.g. computer architecture)

- Linking
    - Not all of the program needs to be compiled at once (e.g. one file is compiled)
    - When executable is created, different compiled sources are linked
    - Re-compilation can be avoided if code hasn't changed

- Advantages and disadvantages
    - Advantages: compile-time code validation, faster, distribute binary file
    - Disadvantages: executable is specific to architecture/OS

- Many vendors; compete for speed, architecture optimization, etc.

- Languages: C, C++
