// Introduction to this section.
= Hardware and Software

This section talks about the relationship between computer hardware and software.

This book takes a "bottom-up" approach to discussing this topic.
We start with a description of the computer hardware,
and end with how source code is executed on the machine.
Along the way, we will talk about the role of the operating system,
processes and threads,
process memory structure,
and compiling or interpreting code.
