= Decomposition and abstraction

- Decomposition: breaking a complex problem/system into smaller parts
    (sometimes called "modules," but this is has a different meaning)
    - creates structure
    - self-contained
    - promotes code re-use

- Abstraction: suppressed details of implementation
    - code is "black box:" takes inputs, responds with output, but how it
      produces that output is immaterial (provided it's correct)
