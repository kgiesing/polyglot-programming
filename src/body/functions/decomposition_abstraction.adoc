= Decomposition and abstraction

* Decomposition: breaking a complex problem/system into smaller parts
    (sometimes called "modules," but this is has a different meaning)
** creates structure
** self-contained
** promotes code re-use

* Abstraction: suppressed details of implementation
** code is "black box:" takes inputs, responds with output, but how it
      produces that output is immaterial (provided it's correct)

*SUMMARY OF REASONS TO CREATE A ROUTINE*

Here's a summary list of the valid reasons for creating a routine:

* Reduce complexity
* Introduce an intermediate, understandable abstraction
* Avoid duplicate code
* Support subclassing
* Hide sequences
* Hide pointer operations
* Improve portability
* Simplify complicated boolean tests
* Improve performance

In addition, many of the reasons to create a class are also good reasons to create a routine:

* Isolate complexity
* Hide implementation details
* Limit effects of changes
* Hide global data
* Make central points of control
* Facilitate reusable code
* Accomplish a specific refactoring
