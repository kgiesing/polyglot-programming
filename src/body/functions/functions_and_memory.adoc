= Functions and memory

== Functions as imperative language constructs
* Function declaration; function signature
* Function compiled as code; calling location is address in program itself

== Functions and stack memory
* Params/local vars are located in stack memory
* Stack frame: data that is created when fn is called - creates context
    (Note: OS's have different implementations)
** argument values (parameters)
** instruction pointer (location of caller)
** local vars
** space for return val can be part of stack frame, but often it is a register (OS dependent)
