= Function Overloading

* Functions with same identifier, but different formal parameters
* Compiler chooses one or the other according to argument number and types

== Pitfalls

There cannot be any ambiguity for the compiler in determining which overloaded function to call.
This can lead to a number of pitfalls.

* return type cannot be used for overloading

* variadic functions

* type coercion
