= Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

== Expressions
* Expression: any piece of code that will produce a result when executed
    (could be a literal, the result of an operation, fn call, etc.)
* Analogy: a "clause" or "sentence fragment"

== Statements
* Statement is a "line" of code that does something
* Analogy: a "sentence"
* Statements can contain multiple expressions
* In C-style languages, statements are followed by a semicolon: `;`
* If a statement results in a value, that value is usually ignored;
  thus, statements usually have side effects (e.g. assignment, output)
* Some languages (e.g. C#) place limits on what can be considered a statement, by the last operation
** declaration statements (declare a variable/constant)
** expression statements (store a value in a variable)
** flow control statements (`if`, `while`, `for`) - see next sections
** _not_ allowed: merely computing a value without storing it:
        `counter + 1;`
            - this results in an error in C# and a warning in everything else
* Some people (who?) call statements "commands"

== Statement Blocks
* Syntax: `{ }`
* Defines a separate block of code
* Used in control structures, functions, etc.
* In most languages, a block creates a separate scope
** but not JavaScript - has function scope; see section on functions
* Many languages allow stand-alone blocks
