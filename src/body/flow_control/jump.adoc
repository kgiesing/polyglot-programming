= Jump statements

== `return` statements

== `break` statements

== `continue` statements

== `goto` statements and labels
WARNING: The use of a `goto` statement is considered bad practice.
    It usually indicates that the programmer has used the wrong algorithm,
    or implemented an algorithm badly.
    If possible, see if you can refactor the code to avoid using `goto`.
