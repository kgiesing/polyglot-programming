= Jump statements

== `return` statements
* used within a function or method to return a value
* will be covered in section on functions

== `break` statements
* used to break out of an iteration statement

== `continue` statements
* used to ignore the rest of the body of an iteration statement, but keep iterating

== `goto` statements and labels
WARNING: The use of a `goto` statement is considered bad practice.
    It usually indicates that the programmer has used the wrong algorithm,
    or implemented an algorithm badly.
    If possible, see if you can refactor the code to avoid using `goto`.

Supported languages: C, C++, C#

* in C#, designed to be used inside `switch` statements to jump to a case

* Java has `goto` as a reserved word, but deliberately removed support for it

* ECMAScript deliberately decided to not support it

* PHP added support for it in 5.3
