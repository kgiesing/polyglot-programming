## Introduction: why I am writing this book ##
[//]: # (from README.md)

* An introduction to coding, for relative beginners, in programming languages
    that share their basic syntax with C.

* A compare-and-contrast between how these languages work, for those who are
    familiar with one language (e.g. JavaScript) but not the others.

* An introduction to the different programming paradigms and semantics that
    these languages support, e.g. procedural vs. object-oriented vs. functional.

* A way to broaden my own knowledge.

## About the Book ##
- "Bottom to top": least abstract to most abstract
  - "Abstract:" relative to the physical computer
  - "Abstract" is not necessarily "complex" (to humans)
- Theory and code
  1. General concepts - terminology, etc.
  2. Syntax - common, then lang-specific
  3. Advanced concepts
     - Beginning programmers don't need to know to write code, but will need
       to learn eventually
     - Put at the end, to be less confusing
     - Often language-specific
- Use of analogies
  - remember that they're only analogies; there to help clarify concepts
  - math (basic), cooking, everyday items (biased towards Americans...)
