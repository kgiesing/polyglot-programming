[glossary]

Keyword::
    a sequence of characters that have special meaning in a language.
    Keywords are considered part of the language syntax, so they can't be used as an identifier.

Reserved word::
    a sequence of characters that have special meaning in a language, but are not necessarily part of the syntax.
    Examples: `goto` in Java, `super` in JavaScript.
    In nearly all languages, keywords are a subset of reserved words.

State::
    the values of data represented by the program, at a particular point in the program's execution.
    - "State" can also refer to the state of execution itself, i.e. which operations have been done, and which are next.
        Most languages can't access this information directly.

Global state::
    the state that is in scope throughout the entire codebase.

Literal::
    a direct representation of data in the source code.
    Examples: `5`, `3.14159`, or `"Sam"`.

Variable::
    a named representation of data, whose value can change
    - similar to math variables, but can represent more than numbers

Constant::
    a named representation of data, whose value cannot change
    - analogies from natural sciences: pi, e (Euler's number), c (speed of light in a vacuum), number of protons in a carbon atom, etc.

Scope::
    the parts of a program where a name has meaning (visible)
    - two identical names will not conflict, only if they have different scopes
    - global: available throughout the entire code (e.g. "global variable," "global state")


Operator::
    a token representing an operation on data.
    Examples: `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `=` for assignment.

Operand::
    a piece of data that is operated on by an operator.
    Example: in the expression `2 + 3`, `+` is the operator, while `2` and `3` are the operands.

Function::
    a named, complex operation on data, often consisting of multiple statements.
    See also: call, invoke, method, parameter, argument

    - similar to math functions, but can have same output for different input
    - method: a function that is associated with an object (see below)
    - call: what you do when you use a function
      - caller: the code that calls a function
      - invoke: generally, a synonym; colloquially, sometimes functions are
        "called" while methods are "invoked"
    - pass: communicate value(s) between caller and function
    - argument: a value passed into a function by the caller
    - parameter: a representation of an argument, for use inside function
      - You can think of them as variables
    - body: the "interior" of a function - the code that accomplishes the
      complex operation; not available to the caller
    - return value: the result of the function's operation, passed back to
      the caller
    - recursion: generally, when a function calls itself (but also: mutual
      recursion)
      - Why: a problem can be solved by finding the solution to smaller
        subsets of the problem; function calls itself with subset as arg(s)

Object::
    "theoretical" definition;;
        any abstract entity that can be represented as data in the code.
        Example: the phrase "functions are first-class objects" means that functions can be represented as data;
        they can be assigned to variables, passed as function arguments, etc.
    OOP definition;;
        a representation
      - holds data that represent state (member variables, fields)
      - has methods that operate according to state (member functions)
      more in section on OOP

Whitespace::
    Characters that represent horizontal or vertical space
    - Taken from typography
    - In C-syntax languages, whitespace is a delimiter; extra whitespace is ignored
    - Whitespace characters, and their literal equivalents (usually an escape sequence):
        - space: `' '`
        - newline: `'\n'`
        - carriage return: `'\r'`
        - horizontal tab: `'\t'`
        - vertical tab: `'\v'`
        - form feed: `'\f'`
